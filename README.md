# COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment Automation Project

## Overview

During the early stages of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, it became evident that those most in need—individuals eligible in Phase 1C and above, such as those aged 65 and older or with severe health concerns—were also those least likely to navigate appointment websites efficiently. Recognizing this discrepancy, I decided to leverage my background in healthcare and software development to assist in the distribution of this lifesaving medication.

## Motivation

Despite moving away from direct healthcare a few years ago, the urgent need for support during the pandemic compelled me to contribute to this critical effort. I began by manually collecting demographic information and scheduling appointments for those unable to do so themselves. To optimize this process, I developed an alerting system that identified available appointment slots across multiple vaccine provider websites, increasing efficiency without compromising ethical considerations.

### Ethical Considerations

In designing the system to assist with COVID-19 vaccine appointments, I focused on leveraging technology to find available slots while consciously avoiding full automation of the booking process. Here's why:

#### Rapid Changes
The early stages of the vaccine rollout were marked by continuous updates, making the automation of form filling a challenge. Automated systems could easily fail to adapt to changes, leading to errors in the booking process. By keeping this step manual, I ensured greater accuracy and adaptability to the evolving situation.

#### Ethical Responsibilities
Automating the discovery of available appointments provided a significant advantage, allowing me to act swiftly on behalf of those less adept at navigating online systems. However, automating the completion of bookings posed ethical concerns. It was crucial to maintain human oversight to ensure fairness and prevent any single system from monopolizing access to vaccine appointments. This approach balanced the benefits of technology with a commitment to equitable access, ensuring that no one was greatly disadvantaged by the automation.



## Impact

From February 1, 2021, to April 16, 2021, I successfully booked vaccine appointments for 55 individuals who might have otherwise faced significant barriers. This effort not only aligned with my professional skills but also my personal values, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in software development, especially in projects impacting life safety.

## Professional Engagement

During this period, I also joined the University of Maryland Medical System, working at their vaccination sites and a field hospital set up at the convention center. Thanks to an emergency extension of my EMS license, I was able to further contribute to the pandemic response efforts.

## Repository Note

The scripts in this repository reflect the urgent and often chaotic nature of the pandemic response. They are presented "as-is" to illustrate the real-world messiness and rapid adaptation required during such a critical time.

I am exceptionally proud and fortunate to have had the opportunity to improve health outcomes during this unprecedented crisis and to share these experiences and tools with the community.









# Vaccine Appointment Tracker

This table lists the date the appointment was made, the initials of individuals, and their eligibility categories. These entries are based on the information available to me, and many were referrals from others, so details on individual circumstances are limited beyond the appointment confirmations.
